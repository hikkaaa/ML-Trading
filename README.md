Machine Learning Applied to Stock &amp; Crypto Trading - Python (by Udemy)


Gain an edge in financial trading through deploying Machine Learning techniques to financial data using Python. In this course, I will:

- Discover hidden market states and regimes using Hidden Markov Models.

- Objectively group like-for-like ETF's for pairs trading using K-Means Clustering and understand how to capitalise on this using statistical methods like Cointegration and Zscore.

- Make predictions on the VIX by including a vast amount of technical indicators and distilling just the useful information via Principle Component Analysis (PCA).

- Use one of the most advanced Machine Learning algorithms, XGBOOST, to make predictions on Bitcoin price data regarding the future.

- Evaluate performance of models to gain confidence in the predictions being made.

- Quantify objectively the accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score on test data to infer your likely percentage edge.

- Develop an AI model to trade a simple sine wave and then move on to learning to trade the Apple stock completely by itself without any prompt for selection positions whatsoever.

- Build a Deep Learning neural network for both Classification and receive the code for using an LSTM neural network to make predictions on sequential data.

- Use Python libraries such as Pandas, PyTorch (for deep learning), sklearn and more.
